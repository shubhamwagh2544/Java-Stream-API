What is stream ?

- Simply, an abstraction
- focuses on ALL instead on PARTS
- imperative to FUNCTIONAL programming (chaining together)
- used with Collections

##
How to use Stream

- Start with concrete implementation
    - arrays
    - sets
    - lists
    - maps
- call .stream() on the concrete type
- we can concatenate stream to one another to form chain
- this chain of stream is ABSTRACTION
- then we go back to concrete implementation again (like list, object, optional, string, int)

findAny() : Non Deterministic :- not necessarily returns same ans
findFirst() : Deterministic :- always returns same ans

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows in a SQL query based on the values in one or more columns.
It's often used in conjunction with aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN) to summarize and analyze data.

Group By Use Cases :
1. Aggregating Data

    SELECT Product, Region, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY Product, Region;

2. Counting Occurrences

    SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;

3. Finding Maximum or Minimum Values

    SELECT Department, MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;

4. Data Segmentation

    SELECT CASE
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN 'Under 30'
        WHEN Age < 60 THEN '30-59'
        ELSE '60 and Over'
    END AS AgeGroup, COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY AgeGroup;

5. Filtering Groups

    SELECT Product, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY Product
    HAVING TotalRevenue > 10000;

6. Eliminating Duplicate Data

    SELECT Email
    FROM Contacts
    GROUP BY Email;
