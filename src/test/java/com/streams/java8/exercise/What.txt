How to use Stream

- Start with concrete implementation
    - arrays
    - sets
    - lists
    - maps
- call .stream() on the concrete type
- we can concatenate stream to one another to form chain
- this chain of stream is ABSTRACTION
- then we go back to concrete implementation again (like list, object, optional, string, int)
